# Workshop-Raspberry

Repository of examples and tutorials for projects combining RaspberryPi + Arduino.

Created and maintained by a group of students of the University of São Paulo.

With RaspberryPi 2, do not forget to configure GCC to compile optimizing to its ARM7: 
gcc -O3 -march=armv7-a -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=hard -Wall test.c -o test

1-	Under folder Raspbian: you will find configuration files and tips to set Debian up correctly for the RAspberryPi2 board.

2-	Under folder SoftwareRaspberry: you will find c code that program RaspberryPi to command an Arduino (Arduino Mini Pro) to control multiple devices and read multiple sensors.

3-	Under folder SoftwareArduino: you will find c code that program Arduino (Arduino Mini Pro) to communicate with RaspberryPi and to control multiple devices and read multiple sensors.

4-	Do not forget also to take a look on our other project with a RaspberryPi controlling a High Speed Robot (85 Km/h) at: https://github.com/simoesusp/high-speed-robot

5-	FernandosProject PDF also present a very interesting design of a remote controlled robot using 2 Raspberrys and Arduinos to pilot a camera using robot via FPV.

6-  Checkout how to connect RaspberryPi and Arduino on Figure ConectingRasptoArduino.jpg. It is just one of the 1000 ways to connect them... but one that works!


Have fun!!
