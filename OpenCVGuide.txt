	INSTALLING OPENCV 2.4.9 ON A RASPBERRY PI

				RODRIGO'S GUIDE
X-----------------------X-----------------------X

This guide assumes you are using Raspbian Linux, you have ssh enabled and are doing everything through the terminal. This install was done on a fresh Raspbian install.


-> UPDATE

Make sure Raspbian is up to date:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade


-> INSTALL DEPENDENCIES

First do this:
	sudo apt-get -y install build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui pkg-config libpng12-0 libpng12-dev libpng++-dev libpng3 libpnglite-dev zlib1g-dbg zlib1g zlib1g-dev pngtools libtiff4-dev libtiff4 libtiffxx0c2 libtiff-tools libeigen3-dev

	Note: You can add in cmake-qt-gui if you want a GUI for cmake, and don’t like ccmake.

Then do:
	sudo apt-get -y install libjpeg8 libjpeg8-dev libjpeg8-dbg libjpeg-progs ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavcodec53 libavformat53 libavformat-dev libgstreamer0.10-0-dbg libgstreamer0.10-0 libgstreamer0.10-dev libxine1-ffmpeg libxine-dev libxine1-bin libunicap2 libunicap2-dev swig libv4l-0 libv4l-dev python-numpy libpython2.6 python-dev python2.6-dev libgtk2.0-dev 

	Note: You don’t need the lib1394 libraries as there is no FireWire on the Raspberry Pi, but something in this list will grab them anyway (sigh). We install in two stages as there is a possibility of broken package errors if the install order is wrong. It may be fine, but why risk having to fix it.


-> INSTALL OPENCV

To download OpenCV 2.4.9, enter the following command:
	wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.9/opencv-2.4.9.zip/download

	Note: If you want to install a older version, copy this link http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix in your browser and choose the version you want.


-> UNZIP AND PREPARE FOR BUILD

	unzip opencv-2.4.9.zip
	cd opencv-2.4.9
	mkdir release
	cd release
	ccmake ../


-> CONFIGURING

press ‘c’ to configure
once done toggle the options you want. This were mine:
