This tutorial teatches how to install and configure the software Motion


    We will be using the terminal so open up terminal on the Pi or via SSH.
 
    Let’s check for any updates for Raspbian and its packages.


sudo apt-get update


sudo apt-get upgrade



    First we will need to download and install motion, to do this enter the following command:

sudo apt-get install motion


    Now we need to make some edits to the configuration file (motion.conf)

:
sudo nano /etc/motion/motion.conf



    Find the following lines and change them to the following.

daemon on

webcam_localhost off

Optional (Don’t include the text in brackets)

webcam_maxrate 100 (This will allow for real-time streaming but requires more bandwidth)

framerate 100 (This will allow for 100 frames to be captured per second allowing for smooth video)

width 640 (This changes the width of the image displayed)

height 480 (This changes the height of the image displayed)


    Now we need to setup up the daemon, first we need to edit the motion file.


sudo nano /etc/default/motion



    Find the following line and change it to the following:

start_motion_daemon=yes


    Now make sure the camera is connected and run the following line

sudo service motion start


    If you need to stop the service simply run the following command

sudo service motion stop

 

    Now to test it out!
