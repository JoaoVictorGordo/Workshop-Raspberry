The Suggested way to connect your RaspberryPi to other hardware devices such as sensors, Leds and buttons is always throughout the use of an Arduino.

It is always better to use a U$ 3,00 Arduino to control motors and noisy signals that harm your Raspberry Arm easily.

That concept consists of a low-level hardware controller such as an Arduino connected to the Raspberry board via a Serial port. 
Just enable the Raspberry Serial port with the raspi-config interface and include a Library such as the WiringPi.h that has serial port configuration functions.

Mind that the Arduino works with 5v and the Raspberry with 3.3v, so you will need a voltage adapting circuit, such as the one presented at figure: ConectingRasptoArduino.JPG

Raspberry   Tx --> buffer --> Arduino Rx
Arduino Tx --> 5v to 3.3v Resistor converter --> Raspbery Rx

It is always possible to connect the Raspberry to the Arduino via a Bluetooth link (se software examples at https://github.com/simoesusp/HomeControl):
Raspberry  <--> Bluetooth Module (IR-10)    <-->    Bluetooth Module (IR-10) <--> Arduino Rx

To supply the Raspberry board using a Battery it is recommended to use a 5V UBEC regulator that can supply at least 2A. It can also be done with the old faithful LM7805 with a generous heat sink.
